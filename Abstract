Lignocellulosic Biomass (LCB) is a renewable resource and potential alternative source for
fossil fuels. Many pretreatment techniques are suitable for the processing and utilization of
LCB. In the biological pretreatment, a cocktail of enzymes are used containing
Endoglucanase, Beta-Glucosidase, Cellobiohydrolase, and most recently lytic polysaccharide
monooxygenase (LPMO). These enzymes act synergistically to convert the crystalline and
amorphous cellulose polymers in LCB to monomeric glucose. With the rapid development of
computing technology, simulation is becoming easier day by day and a more important tool
for understanding the mechanism of action of a complex macromolecule process. Here, we
intend to develop a computational model that captures various scales (in terms of time and
number of components) that can be captured as close to reality. Specifically, we intend to use
a cellulose microfibril constructed using the Cellulose Builder tool, where the 1-beta form made
of beta-D-glucose monomers will be used for constructing a multiscale model. Discrete
Molecular dynamics, Quantum Mechanical calculations, and Coarse-grained dynamics will
be used to understand the model at various scales. We hope to shed light on the synergistic
activity of the four enzymes in the degradation of LCB. Thus understanding the factors that
affect biomass degradation will be important to maximize the yield of glucose from LCB.
